STREAMLINING THE CONTAINER ELEMENTS

* The <cost> element contains everything else. The distinction between <temporary> and <permanent> was more hindring than useful,
given that few permanent costs exist and the single common one (xp) is obviously permanent. 
* If an expense (apart from XP) is permanent, we could model this by adding an attribute: loss=PERMANENT to the cost element in 
question and have that attribute default to TEMPORARY if omitted.
* The <cost> is no longer mandatory. Omission denotes "none" instead of causing an exception.


JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION: CURRENT FORMAT
<essence>  (should we keep this format, I'd like to rename this element to <motes> to better distinguish it from the <essence> prerequisite. 
<willpower>
<health> (can have an optional attribute type=(Lethal|Bashing|Aggravated))
<experience>

PROPOSED NEW FORMAT: 
<cost type=XXX>
with possible types m, wp, lhl, bhl, ahl, xp. The abbreviations are straight from the 2e core rulebook,
but we could also use expanded forms like motes, willpower, lethal, bashing, aggravated, experience.
If the element is omitted, only one additional attribute "cost" is allowed. That attribute contains the 
resource key of the text to be printed, e.g. <cost cost="PermanentStaminaPoint"/> 

Types of cost entries:
FIX AMOUNT, 				5 motes
BASE AMOUNT, 				5 motes or more / 5+ motes (We should use this opportunity to unify the notation.)
LINEAR AMOUNT, 				5 motes per enemy
LINEAR AMOUNT/DICE, 		1 mote per 3 dice
LINEAR AMOUNT/SUCCESSES, 	2 motes per 1 success
FIX AMOUNT + LINEAR AMOUNT, 2 motes + 3 motes per arrow
ALTERNATIVE FIX AMOUNTS, 	3 motes or 5 motes
FIX AMOUNT/TEXT, 			1 mote to summon or banish
SPECIAL TEXT: 				Varies, Special, None   
COMPLEX TEXT, 				Depending on the mood of the Scarlet Empress' last mortal lover.


Points of note:
* Is there a point in having both Varies and Special, appart from their appearance in the various books? 
Is there a case where Special just denotes "too complex to write in the header, but fixed nonetheless?
* COMPLEX TEXT is the format described above as using the <cost cost="XXX"/> format. Could be replaced by
Varies or Special, if desired.
* ADDITIONAL costs or ALTERNATIVE costs could be entered as compound elements <addition> <alternative> and
combined at runtime to give the human-readable text.
* Multiple cost types with the same linear factor, e.g. "1 mote per pot, 1 wp per pot, 1 l health per pot", 
could be rendered as "(1 mote, 1wp, 1 health) per pot" and modeled via a combination element:
  <combination factor="pot">
	<cost type=motes amount=1>
	<cost type=wp amount=1>
	<cost type=lhl amount=1>
  </combination>

Difficulties:
* "5/10 + 1/3 motes per target" => COMPLEX or model via compound elements? Render as "(5 + 1 or 10 + 3) motes per target"?
* Lunars 1st Edition, p129: LunarBloodReshapingTechnique has an odd entry: 
	<health type="Lethal" cost="1" text="+Special"/> => "Special" wp


SIDE NOTE:
Do we still need the "exalt" attribute on top of every charm? For type specific charms, this is pure redundancy. as the charm file is registered for the type in question,
the information can be retrieved from other sources.
For MA charms, it is only used to determine the different looks styles. This is a non-
issue in 2E, where everything looks alike. In 1E, we could either duplicate the frames for the various types to achieve 
independence from character types (and select the frame based on the Martial Arts-level) 
or have the types rendered in a single type of (duplicated) frame. (Siddy, I presume, given their predisposition towards MAs).
