<h2>Technicalities</h2>

<h3>What hardware/software do I need to run Anathema?</h3>
	<p>Anathema will run on any operating system with <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java Runtime Environment</a> Version 6 or later, including Linux and Windows.
		Mac OS X is not yet supported by the Java platform.</p>
	<!--<P> Patch releases require the appropriate regular release to be installed.</p>-->
	<P>See the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a> page for an estimate of hardware requirements.</p>

<h3>Java is installed, but Anathema still won't run.</h3>
	<p>First, ensure that you've extracted all ZIPped files to their full pathnames.<br/>
	If errors persist, please ascertain that you have the latest release.<br/>
	Should all that fail, please provide the following information when contacting us:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which version of Java are you using?
		<li>What is your operating system?
		<li>Which release of Anathema causes the error? [Warning: Trick Question]
		<li>What command or action do you use to launch Anathema?
		<li>Which plugins are installed?
	</ul>

<h3>I'd like further instructions. Any chance?</h3>
	<P>Of course. A quickstart guide can be found on the <a href="?page=downloads">Downloads</a>
	page. An installation guide is available for download on the 
	<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/anathema/AnathemaInstallationGuide_v1.0.pdf?download">project page</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugs & Features</h2>

<h3>Anathema does not allow for the Artifact background to be taken more than once.</h3>
<p> Take a second look at the background selection box, it is editable. Enter a description, name or number for your artifact and everything will be fine.</p>

<h3>Can I have my Second Edition Terrestrial now, pretty please?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, you can't. When deciding on the features for 1.0, we opted not to include support for the newly released Manual of Dragon-Blooded Power, 
instead focussing on features of more general interest. They might not make it into the next version, either, but they will come.</p>

<h3>When will rule/feature X be supported?</h3>
	<P>It's hard to plan ahead more than two releases, and even then there are just as many 
	things that simply "happen to be done along the way", as there are those that "aren't that 
	important right now". The <a href="?page=development">development</a> page will give you a glimpse of the future. <br/> <!--If we don't name your feature there, browse to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=122320&amp;atid=693111">feature requests</a> tracker and submit it after checking it's not already listed.--></p>

<h3>Things don't work right! What should I do?</h3>
	<P>See the <a href="?page=contact">contact</a> page for bug submission information. 
	We try to fix all bugs as soon as possible, and you can make a difference by giving a concise 
	description of what happened.</p>
