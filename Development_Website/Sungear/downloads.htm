<h2>Quickstart Guide</h2>
	<h3>Download</h3>
	<p>
	Go to the 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=122320">SourceForge.net download system</a> for a list of file releases.
	The most recent release is listed at the top. Choose the file most suited for your operating system, or the "raw" .ZIP archive for a generic distribution.
	</p>
	<!--<p>
	Should the release be designated as a "patch", you will need to download and install the respective regular release first.
	</p>-->
	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>
	Regular releases are pre-packed and installed on their own. Auto-installing packages for different operating systems are available.
	If you chose to download the raw package, the archive can simply be extracted into the target directory.</p>
<!--	<P>
	Patches need to be applied to an existing installation to work. To this end, the patch-archive has to be extracted over the existing installation of the corresponding regular release.
	</p>-->
	<h3>Launch</h3>
	<p>Depending on your download choice and operating system, you are provided with a executable file or link for launching Anathema.
	If you chose the raw download, chances are your system allows to launch Anathema by double-clicking "anathema.jar" in the main folder.
	Failing that, you need to open a console window, switch to the installation directory and type "java -jar anathema.jar".</p>
	<h3>Enjoy Anathema!</h3>
